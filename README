# Miscellaneous Scripts

This is just a ramdon collection of scripts I wrote. Maybe they are useful for others as well.

# Documentation
Is inline in the Scripts itself or just self-explanatory

# Warranty and liability
There is none. Use as provided at your own risk. Its always a smart idea to first have a look at scripts before acutally running them.

# Contributions
If you find some mistakes or made some enhancements, let me know
